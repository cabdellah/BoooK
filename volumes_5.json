        "description": "Foreword by Lloyd Kaufman! “Use the combos, keep the feet light. This is it.” That’s Vincent Craig Dupree as boxing champ Julius, psyching himself up for a showdown with, of all people, unstoppable killer Jason Voorhees, in Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan (1989). Perhaps unfamiliar with the fact that a goalie mask is meant to stop rock-hard vulcanized rubber flying at 100 mph, his fists prove laughably ineffective. Jason’s though, are anything but. He punches Julius’s head clean off with one right cross. A fist might seem like unconventional weaponry compared with the knives and axes usually deployed by unspeaking, unfeeling, unstoppable killers in horror films—and it is—but a fist doesn’t even scratch the surface of the weird ways people have been killed in horror. Horror movie victims have had ears of corn buried in their backs; been decapitated by basketballs; lacerated by avant-garde sculptures; skewered by mounted deer antlers; bludgeoned by pogo sticks; punctured with unfurled umbrellas. Discover these oddball deaths and some even stranger ways killers have gone about their grisly business—MOs that would leave even the most seasoned coroner shaking their head—provided that it’s still attached—for in the world of horror, no one is safe. Authors Christopher Lombardo and Jeff Kirschner are Toronto horror journalists and hosts of the Really Awful Movies Podcast, a weekly celebration of low-budget genre films.",

        "description": "Words like \"terrorism\" and \"war\" no longer encompass the scope of contemporary violence. With this explosive book, Adriana Cavarero, one of the world's most provocative feminist theorists and political philosophers, effectively renders such terms obsolete. She introduces a new word \"horrorism\" to capture the experience of violence. Unlike terror, horrorism is a form of violation grounded in the offense of disfiguration and massacre. Numerous outbursts of violence fall within Cavarero's category of horrorism, especially when the phenomenology of violence is considered from the perspective of the victim rather than that of the warrior. Cavarero locates horrorism in the philosophical, political, literary, and artistic representations of defenseless and vulnerable victims. She considers both terror and horror on the battlefields of the Iliad, in the decapitation of Medusa, and in the murder of Medea's children. In the modern arena, she forges a link between horror, extermination, and massacre, especially the Nazi death camps, and revisits the work of Primo Levi, Hannah Arendt's thesis on totalitarianism, and Arendt's debate with Georges Bataille on the estheticization of violence and cruelty. In applying the horroristic paradigm to the current phenomena of suicide bombers, torturers, and hypertechnological warfare, Cavarero integrates Susan Sontag's views on photography and the eroticization of horror, as well as ideas on violence and the state advanced by Thomas Hobbes and Carl Schmitt. Through her searing analysis, Caverero proves that violence against the helpless claims a specific vocabulary, one that has been known for millennia, and not just to the Western tradition. Where common language fails to form a picture of atrocity, horrorism paints a brilliant portrait of its vivid reality.",

        "description": "A journey into the numerous Horror Films of the 80's analyzed under a \"religious\" profile which is purely Catholic. The diversification of the analysis is, of course, an issue that interests us. In fact, of all the films taken into consideration, this journey not only gives a brief opinion of the film, but it also shows the depth and thoughts shared and prepared by the Catholic Cinematographic Center. This Centre analyzes the plot and also evaluates the film under an ethical, moral and religious aspect in order to indicate if Catholics are able to watch it. The result is a really interesting insight and sometimes it has a fun perspective. We must acknowledge, however, that the critical Catholic knows how to diversify religious opinion from the technical-creative aspects. This means that a film can be recognized as a masterpiece but not get the clearance for visibility. 65 deepened critical articles of the most important films of the decade. Over 9000 Horror Movies from 1980 to 1989 linked to external resources for Cast, Posters, Images and Reviews. The electronic version of this book is designed in Kindle, PDF and Epub format. This is an interactive book. An Internet connection is not essential although it is recommended so the reader can take advantage of the many external links that are present in the work.",

        "description": "Horror cinema is a hugely successful, but at the same time culturally illicit genre that spans the history of cinema. It continues to flourish with recent cycles of supernatural horror and torture porn that span the full range of horror styles and aesthetics. It is enjoyed by audiences everywhere, but also seen as a malign influence by others. In this Routledge Film Guidebook, audience researcher and film scholar Brigid Cherry provides a comprehensive overview of the horror film and explores how the genre works. Examining the way horror films create images of gore and the uncanny through film technology and effects, Cherry provides an account of the way cinematic and stylistic devices create responses of terror and disgust in the viewer. Horror examines the way these films construct psychological and cognitive responses and how they speak to audiences on an intimate personal level, addressing their innermost fears and desires. Cherry further explores the role of horror cinema in society and culture, looking at how it represents various identity groups and engages with social anxieties, and examining the way horror sees, and is seen by, society.",

        "description": "As the first detailed English-language book on the subject, Korean Horror Cinema introduces the cultural specificity of the genre to an international audience, from the iconic monsters of gothic horror, such as the wonhon (vengeful female ghost) and the gumiho (shapeshifting fox), to the avenging killers of Oldboy and Death Bell. Beginning in the 1960s with The Housemaid, it traces a path through the history of Korean horror, offering new interpretations of classic films, demarcating the shifting patterns of production and consumption across the decades, and introducing readers to films rarely seen and discussed outside of Korea. It explores the importance of folklore and myth on horror film narratives, the impact of political and social change upon the genre, and accounts for the transnational triumph of some of Korea's contemporary horror films. While covering some of the most successful recent films such as Thirst, A Tale of Two Sisters, and Phone, the collection also explores the obscure, the arcane and the little-known outside Korea, including detailed analyses of The Devil's Stairway, Woman's Wail and The Fox With Nine Tails. Its exploration and definition of the canon makes it an engaging and essential read for students and scholars in horror film studies and Korean Studies alike.",

Frightening images and ideas can be made even more intense when accompanied with frightening musical sounds, and music in horror film frequently makes its audience feel threatened and uncomfortable through its sudden stinger chords and other shock effects. The essays in this collection address the presence of music in horror films and their potency within them. With contributions from scholars across the disciplines of music and film studies, these essays delve into blockbusters like The Exorcist, The Shining, and The Sixth Sense together with lesser known but still important films like Carnival of Souls and The Last House on the Left. By leading us with the ear to hear these films in new ways, these essays allow us to see horror films with fresh eyes.",

This book explores its transformative potential historically across myriad cultures, particularly in relation to its ritual and mythmaking capacities, and its intersection with power, ideology and identity. All of these factors have a direct impact on mask-centric horror cinema: meanings, values and rituals associated with masks evolve and are updated in horror cinema to reflect new contexts, rendering the mask a persistent, meaningful and dynamic aspect of the genre’s iconography. This study debates horror cinema’s durability as a site for the potency of the mask’s broader symbolic power to be constantly re-explored, re-imagined and re-invented as an object of cross-cultural and ritual significance that existed long before the moving image culture of cinema.",

        "description": "Sitting on pins and needles, anxiously waiting to see what will happen next, horror audiences crave the fear and exhilaration generated by a terrifying story; their anticipation is palpable. But they also breathe a sigh of relief when the action is over, when they are able to close their books or leave the movie theater. Whether serious, kitschy, frightening, or ridiculous, horror not only arouses the senses but also raises profound questions about fear, safety, justice, and suffering. From literature and urban legends to film and television, horror's ability to thrill has made it an integral part of modern entertainment. Thomas Fahy and twelve other scholars reveal the underlying themes of the genre in The Philosophy of Horror. Examining the evolving role of horror, the contributing authors investigate works such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818), horror films of the 1930s, Stephen King's novels, Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of The Shining (1980), and Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). Also examined are works that have largely been ignored in philosophical circles, including Truman Capote's In Cold Blood (1965), Patrick Süskind's Perfume (1985), and James Purdy's Narrow Rooms (2005). The analysis also extends to contemporary forms of popular horror and \"torture-horror\" films of the last decade, including Saw (2004), Hostel (2005), The Devil's Rejects (2005), and The Hills Have Eyes (2006), as well as the ongoing popularity of horror on the small screen. The Philosophy of Horror celebrates the strange, compelling, and disturbing elements of horror, drawing on interpretive approaches such as feminist, postcolonial, Marxist, and psychoanalytic criticism. The book invites readers to consider horror's various manifestations and transformations since the late 1700s, probing its social, cultural, and political functions in today's media-hungry society.",

Spanning the decades from the 1930s onward it examines the work of producers and directors as varied as George A. Romero, Pete Walker, Michael Reeves, Herman Cohen, Wes Craven and Brian Yuzna and the ways in which films like Frankenstein (1931), Cat People (1942), The Woman (2011) and American Mary (2012) can be considered “subversive.”",

        "description": "The Creature from the Black Lagoon, the Tingler, the Mole People—they stalked and oozed into audiences’ minds during the era that followed Boris Karloff’s Frankenstein and preceded terrors like Freddy Krueger (A Nightmare on Elm Street) and Chucky (Child’s Play). Ghouls, Gimmicks, and Gold pulls off the masks and wipes away the slime to reveal how the monsters that frightened audiences in the 1950s and 1960s—and the movies they crawled and staggered through—reflected fundamental changes in the film industry. Providing the first economic history of the horror film, Kevin Heffernan shows how the production, distribution, and exhibition of horror movies changed as the studio era gave way to the conglomeration of New Hollywood. Heffernan argues that major cultural and economic shifts in the production and reception of horror films began at the time of the 3-d film cycle of 1953–54 and ended with the 1968 adoption of the Motion Picture Association of America’s ratings system and the subsequent development of the adult horror movie—epitomized by Rosemary’s Baby. He describes how this period presented a number of daunting challenges for movie exhibitors: the high costs of technological upgrade, competition with television, declining movie attendance, and a diminishing number of annual releases from the major movie studios. He explains that the production and distribution branches of the movie industry responded to these trends by cultivating a youth audience, co-producing features with the film industries of Europe and Asia, selling films to television, and intensifying representations of sex and violence. Shining through Ghouls, Gimmicks, and Gold is the delight of the true horror movie buff, the fan thrilled to find The Brain that Wouldn’t Die on television at 3 am.",

        "description": "In the isolated, desolate, decrepit village of Dunwich, Massachusetts, Wilbur Whateley is the hideous son of Lavinia Whateley, a deformed and unstable albino mother, and an unknown father (alluded to in passing by mad Old Whateley, as \"Yog-Sothoth\"). Strange events surround his birth and precocious development. Wilbur matures at an abnormal rate, reaching manhood within a decade. Locals shun him and his family, and animals fear and despise him due to his odor. All the while, his sorcerer grandfather indoctrinates him into certain dark rituals and the study of witchcraft. Various locals grow suspicious after Old Whateley buys more and more cattle, yet the number of his herd never increases, and the cattle in his field become mysteriously afflicted with severe open wounds.Wilbur and his grandfather have sequestered an unseen presence at their farmhouse; this being is connected somehow to Yog-Sothoth. Year by year, this unseen entity grows to monstrous proportions, requiring the two men to make frequent modifications to their residence. People begin to notice a trend of cattle mysteriously disappearing. Wilbur's grandfather dies, and his mother disappears soon afterwards. The colossal entity eventually occupies the whole interior of the farmhouse.Wilbur ventures to Miskatonic University in Arkham to procure their copy of the Necronomicon - Miskatonic's library is one of only a handful in the world to stock an original. The Necronomicon has spells that Wilbur can use to summon the Old Ones, but his family's copy is damaged and lacks the page he needs to open the \"door.\" When the librarian, Dr. Henry Armitage, refuses to release the university's copy to him (and, by sending warnings to other libraries, thwarts Wilbur's efforts to consult their copies), Wilbur breaks into the library at night to steal it. A guard dog, maddened by Wilbur's alien body odor, attacks and kills him with unusual ferocity. When Dr. Armitage and two other professors, Warren Rice and Francis Morgan, arrive on the scene, they see Wilbur's semi-human corpse before it melts completely, leaving no evidence.With Wilbur dead, no one attends to the mysterious presence growing in the Whateley farmhouse. Early one morning, the farmhouse explodes and the thing, an invisible monster, rampages across Dunwich, cutting a path through fields, trees, and ravines, and leaving huge \"prints\" the size of tree trunks. The monster eventually makes forays into inhabited areas. The invisible creature terrorizes Dunwich for several days, killing two families and several policemen, until Armitage, Rice, and Morgan arrive with the knowledge and weapons needed to kill it. The use of a magic powder renders it visible just long enough to send one of the crew into shock. The barn-sized monster screams for help - in English - just before the spell destroys it, leaving a huge burned area. In the end, its nature is revealed: it is Wilbur's twin brother, though it \"looked more like the father than Wilbur did.\"",

        "description": "Essay from the year 2012 in the subject American Studies - Culture and Applied Geography, grade: A, University of Malta, language: English, abstract: Horror genre has its origins in the gothic 19th century novels like Marry Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818) or John Polidori’s The Vampire (1819). Even though horror movie is a typical European genre, it has a long history in American cinema dating back to 1915 silent movie Les Vampires by Freuillade and to one of the first sound movies from 1931, Tod Browning’s famous Dracula. Horror movies may be put into three categories: ones that contain the supernatural elements, in which vampires, ghosts, witchcraft appears; psychological horror, which relies on characters’ fears, their guilt or beliefs; and massacre movies, with scenes of slaughter, brutality and rough treatment (Cinema Studies 184). Although horror movies, as an element of mass culture, may be perceived as simplistic, predictable, lacking depth and simply being an unworthy for analysis, there is a great deal of films that in its content reflect the contemporary problems that occurred in the American society. While many critics consider horror genre as a “low culture,” one must not fail to notice that its significance is enormous. One can sense an inextricable link between film and social concerns, since the role of the film is to project certain fears and concerns of contemporary society as well as to help people to resolve them. As Prawer observed: \"If the terror film is thus connected to our social concerns, it also, paradoxically, helps us to cope with our ordinary life by jolting us out of it\" (60). A popular opinion has it that the popularity of horror movies increases along with the disturbance experienced by the society. Since the 20th century is perceived as the era of the constant social upheaval, the history of the horror movie equals the history of the anxiety (Wells 3); hence, the time the cultural chaos erupts, the audience turns to horror movies as a means that liberates them from their anxiety. As Phillips asserts, “anxiety tends to promote a sense of helplessness; fear, on the other hand, provides an impetus for change” (9). Thus, the fear evoked by the slasher film, one is forced to invent new ways of coping with his or her difficulties, since a typical way of thinking will occur not only problematic but also troublesome.",

        "description": "Ever since horror leapt from popular fiction to the silver screen in the late 1890s, viewers have experienced fear and pleasure in exquisite combination. Wheeler Winston Dixon's fully revised and updated A History of Horror is still the only book to offer a comprehensive survey of this ever-popular film genre. Arranged by decades, with outliers and franchise films overlapping some years, this one-stop sourcebook unearths the historical origins of characters such as Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Wolfman and their various incarnations in film from the silent era to comedic sequels. In covering the last decade, this new edition includes coverage of the resurgence of the genre, covering the swath of new groundbreaking horror films directed by women, Black and queer horror films, and a new international wave in body horror films. A History of Horror explores how the horror film fits into the Hollywood studio system, how the distribution and exhibition of horror films have changed in a post-COVID world, and how its enormous success in American and European culture expanded globally over time. Dixon examines key periods in the horror film-in which the basic precepts of the genre were established, then banished into conveniently reliable and malleable forms, and then, after collapsing into parody, rose again and again to create new levels of intensity and menace. A History of Horror, supported by rare stills from classic films, brings over sixty timeless horror films into frightfully clear focus, zooms in on today's top horror Web sites, and champions the stars, directors, and subgenres that make the horror film so exciting and popular with contemporary audiences.",

        "description": "The gothic, particularly in its contemporary incarnations, is often constructed around largely disembodied concepts such as spectrality or the haunted. Body Gothic offers a counter-narrative that reinstates the importance of viscerality to the gothic mode. It argues that contemporary discourses surrounding our bodies are crucial to our understanding of the social messages in fictional mutilation and of the pleasures we may derive from it. This book considers a number of literary and cinematic movements that have, over the past three decades, purposely turned the body into a meaningful gothic topos. Each chapter in Body Gothic is dedicated to a different corporeal subgenre: splatterpunk, body horror, the new avant-pulp, the slaughterhouse novel, torture porn and surgical horror are all covered in its pages. Close readings of key texts by Clive Barker, Richard Laymon, Joseph D'Lacey, Matthew Stokoe, Tony White or Stanley Manly are provided alongside in-depth analyses of landmark films such as Re-Animator (1985), The Fly (1986), Saw (2004), Hostel (2005), The Human Centipede (2011) and American Mary (2012).

        "description": "As any horror fan knows, the genre isn't limited to ghouls, blood, and gore, but is as broad as cinema itself. Discover the haunting pull of \"the other side\" in movies like The Sixth Sense, Cat People, Poltergeist and Don't Look Now. Brave the perils of nature in Jaws, The Birds, and Alien. Learn that people aren't always as they seem, as in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Peeping Tom, Psycho, and The Shining. Confront evil in human form--The Last House on the Left, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Friday the 13th--and in its purer distillation in Rosemary's Baby, The Omen and The Exorcist.101 Horror Films You Must See Before You Die gives you a thorough appreciation of the genre, because it approaches the subject chronologically. You'll move through gothic classics like James Whale's The Old Dark House (1932) and Terence Fisher's Dracula (1958), to zombie movies like Dawn of the Dead (1978) and 28 Days Later (2002). All the sub-genres are covered too, from Eyes Without a Face (mad scientist), The Howling (werewolf), Nightmare on Elm Street (slasher), to The Silence of the Lambs (serial killer). And you'll learn that it's not just American teenagers who are horror-film fodder. There are classic horror films from Japan (Onibaba), Russia(Vij), Italy (Suspiria), France (Les Diaboliques), Belgium (Man Bites Dog), Germany (M), and the Netherlands (The Vanishing). Immerse yourself in the most compelling of movie genres. Prepare to be possessed--and whatever you do, don't answer the phone...",

Ancient grimoires such as the Necronomicon serve as timeless vessels of knowledge beyond human comprehension, while runes, summoning diaries, and spell books offer their readers access to the powers of the supernatural—but at what cost? This collection of new essays examines nearly a century of genre horror in which on-screen texts drive and shape their narratives, sometimes unnoticed. The contributors explore American films like The Evil Dead (1981), The Prophecy (1995) and It Follows (2014), as well as such international films as Eric Valette’s Malefique (2002), Paco Cabeza’s The Appeared (2007) and Lucio Fulci’s The Beyond (1981).",

        "description": "Il presente libro nasce come tentativo di sintetico catalogo ragionato del cinema horror degli anni 80 compiuto da uno spettatore che nel 1980 aveva cinque anni e nel 1990 quindici, quindi uno spettatore fortemente influenzabile e che, pertanto, risente, nei giudizi, delle proprie memorie di giovane testimone, delle paure e delle inquietudini che le tematiche horror gli trasmettevano. L'approccio ai film avviene pertanto su basi fortemente affettive e nostalgiche. L'angolo di prospettiva seguito, è francamente unilaterale: non si è voluto rifare qui una storia generale ed approfondita del cinema horror dal 1980 al 1990, ma verificare l'influenza diretta delle varie tematiche sulla produzione internazionale, le imitazioni del passato e gli indirizzi e le nuove mete indicate dai maestri quali Tobe Hooper, Wes Craven, Kubrick, Carpenter, ect. ect.. Così analizzando le varie tematiche e le piccole o grandi ideologie che esse trasmettono potremo ritrovare alcuni tratti tipici di fortunatissimi filoni quali Halloween, Venerdì 13, solo per citare i più importanti. Inoltre un viaggio nel Cinema Horror degli anni 80 analizzato sotto un profilo laico ed il profilo religioso, prettamente cattolico. Diversificazioni di analisi, certo, ma un sicuro approfondimento delle tematiche che ci interessano. Infatti di tutti i film presi in considerazione, non solo si dà un sintetico giudizio laico, ma si riporta anche l’approfondita Scheda redatta dal Centro Cattolico Cinematografico che analizza la trama, valuta il film sotto il profilo etico-morale-religioso, al fine di indicare ai Cattolici se può essere visto o meno. Ne viene fuori uno spaccato veramente interessante e, a volte, addirittura divertente. Bisogna dare atto, però, che la critica cattolica sa diversificare il giudizio religioso da quello tecnico-creativo. Ciò vuol dire che un film può essere riconosciuto come un capolavoro, ma non per questo ottenere il nulla osta di visibilità. Il libro è stato concepito per l’editoria elettronica è come tale ha delle peculiarità che il libro cartaceo non ha. La principale è quella della interattività. Non indispensabile ma opportuna. Disponendo di una connessione internet sul proprio lettore di ebook sarà possibile collegarsi, ad esempio, a Wikipedia potendo così consultare una scheda approfondita del film e del suo regista. Inoltre subito dopo l’introduzione si riportano tutti i film horror usciti dal 1980 al 1989 linkati a IMDB e a MRQE per le recensioni in lingua inglese.",

However, the majority of performers in even the most popular horror films remain relatively unknown. This engaging collection of profiles introduces many of the actors behind the heroes, heroines, monsters and villains who have terrified and fascinated moviegoers around the world. From Michelle Argyris, who embodied a possessed college student in Devil Seed (2012), to Ian Whyte, the 7 foot tall former basketball player who portrayed one of cinema's most iconic monsters in Aliens vs. Predator (2004), the profiles offer insight into how the actors prepared for and performed their roles. Longer essays explore the casts of renowned horror series, including Saw, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th, providing a window into the world of horror filmmaking.",

Wilder and weirder than you can imagine, they were some of the most outrageous and shocking comics ever produced. The comics were hugely successful due in part to their uninhibited mix of twisted humor, gory violence, and up-front eroticism; however, what makes them so sought-after today is their technicolor cover illustrations rendered by classically trained painters. One of the most notorious of the cover artists was Roberto Molino, whose artworks often parodied the popular TV shows and films of the day, including Kojak (Kondor), The Bionic Woman (Bionika), and Rambo (Raimbo). This book brings together some of the sexiest and most provocative examples of his work, which is highly coveted by collectors today.",
