They will never do paid mercenary work, no matter how good the offer, for they are explorers and not mercenaries. They will complete every mission they undertake, no matter how much trouble it gets them into. And they will never give up, regardless of whatever menacing aliens or dangerous obstacles they run into. When Space returns to Earth in response to a letter he receives from his estranged, ex-super soldier mother, he learns of a plot to murder her and now must protect his mother's life from the mysterious killers who want her dead.

        "description": "We are all familiar with the idea of the action hero as a latterday avenger with a gun—Dirty Harry, Chuck Norris' screen heroes, Rambo. Yet, how did the idea of such heroes emerge in the first place? Why did it explode as it did in the 1970s and, still more, the 1980s, defining the Hollywood action films of that decade? And why did it fall out of fashion? PARAMILITARY ACTION-ADVENTURE FICTION: A HISTORY examines all these questions, and much more, as it traces the rise of paramilitary action heroes in the tensions and fears underlying the civil image of the nineteenth century, through the stresses of the world wars and the Cold War, to the emergence by the 1960s of commandos fighting undeclared wars on the streets of urban America—and the evolution of that image in the half century since.",

James Brownstone wanted to keep it simple... He never saw Shay Carson coming. She brings her own brand of trouble to the table.

Brownstone is at to a fever pitch to understand Shay and create something epic, so he makes a decision to ask someone hundreds of years old. The fight of his life and for his life is about to occur. Will he have a future when all is said and done? James' people are being attacked even though they are just trying to help someone delusional. At some point, the only option remaining on the table is action. As an anomaly, a Vax Forerunner with ethics is a researcher's dream. The problem is that no one is willing to allow James to become a science experiment, especially not James. Brownstone is ok with the truth of his origins. Will others allow him to just be? Scroll back to the top and click \"Read for Free\" or \"Buy Now\" and kick back for a fun, action-packed adventure that will have you yelling for the good guys and laughing at just how badly Brownstone can infuriate Shay, especially with his fashion sense. And how thoroughly Shay mystifies Brownstone as she tries to uncover what makes him tick. --- NOTE: This book contains cursing. Perhaps humorous cursing, but cursing nonetheless.

I remember listening to a great poet recite a poem, you might call a literary masterpiece, for President Obama, and the metaphors and symbolism went way over my head so everything felt flat. It just seems better to read something that sounds like it was written by human beings and I needed a little excitement in the poem so I attempted stuff I liked. Many moons later here I am with about 40 street poems, at least stuff I can understand. It's stuff I've shared with friends and family so they like what I write but I also wanted to impress strangers with something that bridged the gap between cultures. I put myself in prehistoric times and tried to capture the essence of what it felt like to breathe the air. Then I imagined how I would react if I witnessed the secrets of Roswell on that fateful day. Just going back and forth through time, unearthing amazing facts and trivia helped me to assimilate the forces of nature and the smells and sounds that ravish the seven senses. I touch on dragons, volcanoes, ice capped mountains, clones, robots, beauty and power. Genres include science fiction, romance, magic, action, drama, military and all the fun introspective stuff we sometimes neglect in everyday life. I tried to create a roller coaster ride full of sensory overload for all ages to enjoy.",

It's time to find out more about the Unbelievable Mr. Brownstone. James isn't from Earth or Oriceran. Where he is from has been a question for years. Will we find out now, or will those who seek to kill what James can become win in the end? One thing is certain: no one should count James Brownstone out of a fight, even if it doesn't look like he can win. Shay knows this. She has been trying to get him to wear something besides that ratty gray coat for a long time. He can also be an obstinate SOB. Just ask Whispy Doom. Scroll back to the top and click \"Read for Free\" or \"Buy Now\" and kick back for a fun, action-packed adventure that will have you yelling for the good guys and laughing at just how badly Brownstone can infuriate Shay, especially with his fashion sense. And how thoroughly Shay mystifies Brownstone as she tries to uncover what makes him tick. --- NOTE: This book contains cursing. Perhaps humorous cursing, but cursing nonetheless. If this offends you, I don't suggest reading this book.",

Afraid for her life, Ember is relieved to find that her kidnappers want her to take on an extremely dangerous, top secret job. After her last life or death situation, Ember vowed to keep her head down - but she finds herself in no position to argue. With reluctance, she agrees to one final job: she's to use her hacking skills to track down a Russian syndicate that's infiltrating every sector of the United States government. If she succeeds, she'll walk away with a staggering four million dollar payday. If she fails, she'll watch as the syndicate takes down the government as she knows it. And that's just the easy part. Rylan's obsessed with tracking down the whereabouts of his prototype - unaware that Ember is secretly behind the theft. Ember feels her relationship with Rylan crumbling as he draws nearer and nearer to discovering Ember's betrayal. Then there's Xander - a young, untested hacker barely out of high school that Ember is forced to work with. To top everything off, Rylan also hires a new member at his firm - Natasha, an attractive women that Rylan seems to be falling for. In the background lurks Seth Mathews, the dangerous hacker and one time partner of Rylan. He's been secretly pulling strings and influencing those around him for years, and he's finally decided it's time to put his master plan in motion. There's only two more unknown variables he needs to account for: Ember and Rylan. But unknown to them, Seth Mathews doesn't want them dead. On the contrary: he wants them to join his team and help him take down the world. But when faced with another life or death situation, will Ember and Rylan join Seth Mathews for survival, or will they refuse and die fighting?",

That takes money, and Mac uses her only skills—those of soldiering—when she takes up a security contract in Iraq. She doesn’t have time for men, her last vacation fling in Fiji relegated as one perfect moment to hold close during the grim reality of war. Soldier Louie Lithgow is tired of fighting, the constant danger, and has decided this is his last contract. He wants to retire, sink his savings into a place on the beach, and find the sexy Joanna, his holiday lover. Mac’s arrival in Iraq causes consternation. They’ve both been economical with the truth, but the attraction sizzling between them flares hot and bright. They embark on a clandestine affair—professional and confident during their high-danger day, passionate with the release of emotional stress during their torrid nights. One thing is clear—they have different goals and the future is both murky and dangerous. If they survive their contracts.",

It's time for her and Fyre to visit New Atlantis and find out what the fuss is all about. Both gangs in the Crescent City are fighting for control, with Cali and her friends in the middle. To do nothing is to risk those she cares about on a daily basis. One of those, Tanyith, has his own people to protect, as the people who broke him out of Trevilsom prison finally reveal themselves. Her parents left behind secrets she needs to understand, mysteries with no clear solution. The shadowy figures behind the Kraken attack might be involved, or might be just another bunch of people seeking to mess with her life for no apparent reason. Watch out, New Atlantis, Caliste Leblanc is on her way to New Atlantis to bring the fight to you. Assuming nothing crazy happens when she travels through the Bermuda Triangle on the way there. For magic, mystery, martial arts, and all the mayhem a canine-sized dragon can bring, join the Blues right away! Scroll up and click 'Read for Free' or 'Buy Now' and read it today.",

        "description": "\"WARSHIP POSEIDON\" was previously released as \"SKULL EYE ISLAND\" the first book in the Adventures of Jonathan Moore series. It is a YA and above historically-based, action-adventure fiction book. Homeless and alone on the streets of London in 1800, twelve year-old Jonathan Moore survives a harsh and dangerous world using courage, intelligence and determination. His dismal fate changes dramatically one day after he is abducted by a gang and pressed into service aboard the warship HMS Poseidon, a forty-four gun fighting frigate of the British Royal Navy. However, there is more to the event than just a change of address. How is it that some members of the crew, including the Captain, already know his name? Why do the officers seem to favor him above the other new crewmembers? As Jonathan endeavors to solve these mysteries, he is thrust into a daring mission to recover a hidden treasure on a remote Caribbean isle. Unfortunately, the crew and officers of the Poseidon are not the only ones searching for the prize. In a desperate race across the Atlantic, Jonathan is pitted against sword-wielding spies, engages in terrifying ship- to-ship battles and in the end, must match his wits and courage against a ruthless and cunning French Captain and the infamous French battleship Danielle. Warship Poseidon is the winner of the 2012 Clive Cussler Collector's Society's Grand Master Award and the 2015 Independent Author Network's Outstanding Action Adventure Novel of the Year. Kirkus reviews: \"A heartwarming tale of a boy essentially orphaned in search of his father, the novel never ceases to entertain as Jonathan learns the ropes of sea life. The reader learns the ship's nomenclature, discipline and command structure, food preparation, the proper loading and operation of cannon. One even learns the difference between how British and French ships operated back in the early 1800s. Characters are interesting and sympathetic, or unsympathetic, as the case may be. The reader will grow to admire the officers of the Poseidon and her crew-and despise French Capt. Champagne and his knife-wielding cohort, Marcel. Greene's swashbuckling tale of high-seas adventure is pure, uncomplicated fun.\" Clive Cussler: \"A robust story of a young lad in the British navy during the Nelson years. A thorough insight and beautiful portrait of those days under wind-blown sails and the creak of wooden hulls. Peter Greene has created a story that shines from every page. An excellent book. He truly nails an insight of nineteenth century sailing ships and their crews.\" PREVIOUSLY RELEASED AS \"SKULL EYE ISLAND\"",

This latest offering from Neptune Island bestselling author Tony Reed packs a triple wallop as Lincoln and Mich cross the Sonoran Desert in search of a lost heirloom, a forgotten goldmine, and deadly cargo. Ex-cops turned adventurers Lincoln Monk and Mich Lee leave the rat race with a simple plan: travel the world, work along the way, and live the dream. But life seldom goes according to plan. When Lincoln and Mich are hired by the sultry daughter of an Arizona land baron, little do they suspect that the simple task of retrieving a family heirloom will lead to a series of deadly encounters with rival families, corrupt police, and relentless mercenaries as they cross the stunning but lethal Sonoran desert. From bone-crunching highway chases, to drone attacks, to gun-battles above and below the Sonoran landscape and more, much more, the Metal, Sand, and Blood Omnibus is sure to keep fans of fast-paced action/adventure turning the pages and wanting more long after the last shot is fired.
